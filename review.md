## Tensorflow tools for text retrieval problems

### Abstract

Tensorflow is one of the advanced and most-used Machine Learning tool. Tensorflow is mostly focused on Deep Learning, but its functions and even pre-trained models can be quite helpful for traditional NLP. In this article I will describe Tensorflow features for NLP and text retrieval along with brief code examples on Python. I will cover text processing tools; ML tools for Natural language processing; existing datasets and pre-trained models; and, finally, sulitions for text retrieval problems.
